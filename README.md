# List of OWL Reasoner

This repository contains a list of information about OWL reasoners as well as systems, which use a third-party OWL reasoner. Further additions and changes are welcome.

## Briefly about the history

My findings during a systematic literature-, software- and internet study about OWL reasoners and systems using a third-party reasoner were documented in the raw files you find here.
The research took place in 2023 and the list doesn't claim to be complete.
All results of that research were published in the following paper:

**BibTeX:**

      archivePrefix={arXiv},

## Content

### Reasoner overview

[**reasoner.csv**](./reasoner.csv) contains a list of available OWL reasoners.
Each entry contains information about project maintenance status, if software is still usable, version, license, code repository links etc.

### Software using a third-party reasoner

[**systems-using-third-party-reasoner.csv**](./systems-using-third-party-reasoner.csv) contains a list of software, which uses a third-party reasoner.
It is similar structured as *reasoner.csv*.

### Bibliography

File [**paper.bib**](./paper.bib) contains all publications used for my research.
Most of them are publications regarding OWL reasoners.
